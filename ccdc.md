### What is it?

Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition is where you take the skills you learn to the next level:
defending a small business network in real time from trained cybersecurity experts. A true test
of grit and knowledge, CCDC has a reputation of being highly demanding, yet also highly rewarding.


### What does joining look like?

Joining CCDC means joining a team of highly motivated individuals who meet every week to
learn about new defense techniques, common security mistakes, and proper setup and configuration.


### I'm new!
While sometimes overwhelming, CCDC is a great place to jump in for beginners as well, since
the team structure is meant to facilitate cooperative learning and many CCDC veterans are
happy to help explain
