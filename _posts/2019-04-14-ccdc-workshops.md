Hello everyone, David Here. We have made a few changes for the workshops this quarter.

First we will be doing another workshop on Week 9, same time and place, where I will be going over a bit on what CCDC injects look like. I will explain what different injects require each team to do, how someone might supply and communicate the information for an inject, and what a finished and completed inject might look like.

Second, in order to provide for the people that are not able to attend the workshops from 3-4 we will have the practice network, or at least part of it, up every Friday after the workshops from 4-5 in ICS 432. This is NOT another workshop and we will NOT be teaching the material again, this is only a network to practice the tools we introduce, and ask questions if you are having any difficulties. In order to help you prepare for these we will release the workshop slides early, on Slack. You should look over these slides and be very familiar with the material and content before trying to practice the tools on the practice network.

In addition to the information that you may read on the slides, or hear us talk about during the workshops, we recommend you look deeper into the topics we present as we can not cover them very in depth during the small time that we have. We will release some suggestions of topics and materials we recommend to learn more about, and we can answer questions or confusions you have regarding these additional topics.

I hope to see you next Friday, and am excited to help you become more skilled security professionals and competitors.


Best,

*David*
